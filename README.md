# NLP-Analysis-using-SpaCy---Dependency-Parsing
This repository contains the code used to extract the nominal subject parsing count from adult utterances. The relationship between caregivers trained in EMT and child language outcomes were assessed. 

This will be the foundation for further code that will identify unique nominal subjects and unique subject/verb combinations.

The SALT transcripts used in this analysis will not be made available.
